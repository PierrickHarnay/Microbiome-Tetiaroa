# Microbiome-Tetiaroa
This study was conducted on the Tetiaroa atoll in French Polynesia. The purpose of the study is to show the impact/benefit of the deratting of the island. 
A total of 3 motus are studied (Reiono, Rimatu'u and Aie). Within these motus Reiono as well as Aie do not have rats while Rimatu'u has been deratted during 2022. Two zones were defined per motus. On each motus coral samples as well as water samples were sampled.
